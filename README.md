# Netflix Clone

This is a solo project where I built a Netflix clone, an OTT platform, from scratch. The goal of this project was to recreate the popular Netflix interface and functionality using modern web technologies.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out.
- Browse movies and TV shows: Users can explore a vast collection of movies and TV shows available on the platform.
- Search functionality: Users can search for specific movies or TV shows.
- Playback: Users can stream movies and TV shows directly on the platform.
- Personalized recommendations: The platform provides personalized movie and TV show recommendations based on the user's viewing history.
- Responsive design: The interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: React, Redux, CSS
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Deployment: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

## Deployment

The Netflix clone is deployed and hosted on AWS, ensuring high availability and scalability. You can access the deployed application by visiting [Netflix Clone](http://3.87.22.183:8080/).
